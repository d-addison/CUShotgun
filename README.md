# CUShotgun - Website for the Carleton University Trap and Skeet Team

## Link: https://cutrapandskeet.herokuapp.com/

## Purpose:
The purpose of this website was to be able to more easily reach out to students and provide information to students.
This is a great way to stand out among other clubs who may not have a website, and just gives us more chance at building our community.

## Building & Running
To run this project, simply copy the [sample config](./config-sample.js) to a file named `config.js` and add your credentials. Then run `npm install` and `npm start`
